## About the Data

Data from the Texas Department of Health State Services are used for all metrics. The "Statewide Total" is manually calculated by aggregating values from all available trauma service areas (TSAs). This aggregation is incomplete because TSA-F (Paris) and TSA-R (Galveston) are missing data prior to May 29, 2020.
