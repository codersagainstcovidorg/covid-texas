## About the Data

Data from the Texas Department of Health State Services are used for all metrics. The "Statewide Total" is manually calculated by aggregating values from all trauma service areas (TSAs) to populate empty rows in the released spreadsheets. These aggregated values are incomplete because TSA-F (Paris) and TSA-R (Galveston) are missing data prior to May 29, 2020.
